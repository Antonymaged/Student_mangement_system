To see the source code run system.cpp
but to run the program run a.out

Function:
This program will be a student mange system for a university but it is still under construction in this point the program ask you to chose between regesteration or loging in if you regester it will ask you for how meny person you want to add to your data base which is a text file contains all names ages and mobile numbers for the people who registered but now if you ask to log in it will only print hi .
